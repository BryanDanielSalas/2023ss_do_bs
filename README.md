Test repository.

Markdown will be used in class.

The class is at [CBS](https://cbs.de)

We are going to learn:

- How digital organizations work.
- What types of organizations exist.
- Present it in the browser.

We are also pretending we are developers, because:

1. We use the CLI - Command Line Interface/Terminal.
1. We learn about the GitHub workflow.
1. We will make a presentation in the browser
1. We are cool and make only hand-written graphs that we have developed ourselves.
